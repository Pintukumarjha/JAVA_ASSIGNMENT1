step1:-setup

First,you need a data source that maps geographical coordinates to country boundaries. A Common  approch is to
use shapefiles,but for simplicity we will use static data structure in this example.

step-2:- java program structure

create a class 'CountryLocator' with a method 'getCountryCode(double latitude,double longitude) to perform the mapping

step-3:-write unit tests to validate the functionality of 'getCountyCode' method

step 4:- create a performance testing to measure the average execution time

Notes:-

1.Data source:In a real world scenario, you would use more accurate boundary data.
2.Performance Testing: Adjust 'requestPerSecond' and 'numRequests' values as needed to simulate different load conditions.
